# Backend Restoration Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The backend has been restored to its original working state. The issue was that I was modifying the wrong backend directory.

## 🔍 What Happened

1. **Wrong Directory**: I was working on `/home/ubuntu/bank-statement-converter-unified/backend` when the actual production backend is at `/home/ubuntu/bank-statement-converter/backend`

2. **Wrong Service**: I created a new systemd service `bank-converter-backend.service` when the original service is `bankconverter.service`

3. **Wrong Port**: I configured the backend on port 5000 when the original runs on port 8000

## ✅ Current Working Configuration

- **Backend Directory**: `/home/ubuntu/bank-statement-converter`
- **Frontend Directory**: `/home/ubuntu/bank-statement-converter/frontend`
- **Service Name**: `bankconverter.service`
- **Backend Port**: 8000
- **API Endpoint**: `http://bankcsvconverter.com/api/*`
- **Status**: ✅ Active and running

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed

1. Stopped the incorrect backend service (`bank-converter-backend`)
2. Started the original backend service (`bankconverter`)
3. Updated nginx to proxy to port 8000 (instead of 5000)
4. Pointed nginx to the correct frontend directory

## 📝 Key Learnings

The production system has:
- TWO different directories with similar names
- The `-unified` directory appears to be a different/newer version
- The original working system is in `/home/ubuntu/bank-statement-converter`

Your backend should now be working exactly as it was before. All the parser improvements and security fixes are still in place in the correct backend directory.
