                <h2>About Truist Bank - The BB&T and SunTrust Merger</h2>
                <p>Truist Financial Corporation, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, was formed in December 2019 through the merger of equals between BB&T (Branch Banking and Trust Company) and SunTrust Banks. This historic $66 billion merger created the sixth-largest commercial bank in the United States, serving more than 10 million consumer households across 17 states and Washington, D.C.</p>
                
                <p>The merger brought together two storied financial institutions with complementary strengths. BB&T, founded in 1872 in Wilson, North Carolina, had built a reputation for community banking and strong customer relationships across the Southeast. SunTrust, established in 1891 in Atlanta, Georgia, brought expertise in wealth management and corporate banking. Together as Truist, they combine 275+ years of banking heritage with modern financial technology and services.</p>
                
                <p>Our Truist statement converter seamlessly handles statements from all three formats - current Truist statements as well as legacy BB&T and SunTrust statements. Whether you're managing the transition from your old BB&T or SunTrust accounts or working with new Truist accounts, our converter ensures all your financial data is accurately transformed into usable CSV/Excel formats.</p>
