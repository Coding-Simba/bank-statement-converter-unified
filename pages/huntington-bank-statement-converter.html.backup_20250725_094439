                    <h3>üíº Business Banking Best Practices</h3>
                    <p>For Huntington business accounts with high transaction volumes, convert statements monthly rather than quarterly. This makes reconciliation easier and helps identify cash flow patterns. Use Excel's pivot tables to analyze spending by vendor or category.</p>
