                    <li>Statement period and account summary</li>
                    <li>Detailed transaction list with dates, descriptions, and amounts</li>
                    <li>Check images for checking accounts (when applicable)</li>
                    <li>Running balance after each transaction</li>
                    <li>Fee summary and interest calculations</li>
