## Summary

### Enhanced Parser Improvements:
1. **Correctly filters invalid amounts**: The $9.7e+16 amount is clearly a parsing error
2. **Preserves legitimate transactions**: All 9 valid transactions are kept
3. **Handles large but plausible amounts**: POS purchases in hundreds of thousands are kept (business transactions)

### Totals Comparison:
- **Current Parser**: Cannot calculate meaningful total due to $9.7e+16 error
- **Enhanced Parser**: 
  - Total Deposits: $10,119.00
  - Total Withdrawals: -$740,119.61
  - Net: -$730,000.61

### Recommendation:
The enhanced parser correctly handles this PDF by filtering out the corrupted transaction while preserving all legitimate ones. The large POS purchase amounts are kept as they could represent legitimate business transactions (under $1M threshold).
