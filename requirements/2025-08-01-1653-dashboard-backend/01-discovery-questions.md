## Q1: Will the modern dashboard need to support real-time updates or notifications when new conversions are completed?
**Default if unknown:** No (current implementation uses 60-second polling, which is sufficient)

## Q2: Should the dashboard display subscription/payment-related information like current plan details and upgrade options?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (the dashboard already shows "Account Type" and has upgrade quick actions)

## Q3: Will users need the ability to bulk operate on multiple conversions at once (e.g., bulk download, bulk delete)?
**Default if unknown:** No (current UI shows individual actions per conversion)

## Q4: Should the dashboard include analytics or insights features beyond the basic statistics currently shown?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (there's already an "Analyze Transactions" tool referenced in navigation)

## Q5: Do we need to implement data export functionality for usage history and conversion logs?
**Default if unknown:** No (focus on core dashboard functionality first)
