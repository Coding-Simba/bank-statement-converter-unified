# Detail Questions

Based on the codebase analysis, these questions clarify specific implementation details.

## Q6: Should email changes require verification through the new email address before updating the user's account?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (prevents email hijacking and ensures the new email is valid and accessible)

## Q7: Will the 2FA implementation use time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) compatible with apps like Google Authenticator?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (TOTP is the industry standard and most user-friendly approach)

## Q8: Should the API key generation create keys with specific scopes/permissions or will all API keys have full access?
**Default if unknown:** No (full access keys are simpler to implement initially, scopes can be added later)

## Q9: Will account deletion be immediate or should there be a grace period where users can recover their account?
**Default if unknown:** No (immediate deletion is simpler, but we'll send a confirmation email first)

## Q10: Should the notification preferences include granular controls (e.g., separate toggles for security alerts, product updates, etc.)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (users expect granular control over different types of communications)
