## Q1: Are users experiencing login issues across all browsers and devices?
**Answer:** Yes
**Implication:** The issue is systematic and not browser-specific, requiring a fundamental fix to the authentication system.

## Q2: Should the authentication persist even after closing and reopening the browser?
**Answer:** Yes
**Implication:** We need to implement long-lived authentication tokens or persistent cookies that survive browser restarts.

## Q3: Are there any security compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) that affect how long users can stay logged in?
**Answer:** Yes
**Implication:** We need to implement configurable session timeouts and ensure compliance with data retention policies.

## Q4: Do users currently have access to a "Remember Me" checkbox on the login form?
**Answer:** Yes
**Implication:** The UI already has this feature, so we need to ensure the backend properly handles the remember me functionality.

## Q5: Should the authentication system support multiple concurrent sessions (same user logged in on different devices)?
**Answer:** Yes
**Implication:** We need to implement proper session management that tracks multiple active sessions per user.
