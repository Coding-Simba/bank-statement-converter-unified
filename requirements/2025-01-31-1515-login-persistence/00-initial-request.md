# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-01-31 15:15
**Request:** Fix login issues and user login sessions throughout the website. The user should stay logged in until they log out.

## Problem Statement
Users are experiencing login issues where:
1. They are randomly logged out when navigating between pages
2. Authentication doesn't persist across page refreshes
3. Login sessions are not maintained consistently across the website

## Desired Outcome
- Users should remain logged in across all pages on the website
- Authentication should persist through page refreshes
- Login state should only be cleared when user explicitly clicks "Log out"
- Consistent authentication experience throughout the entire website
