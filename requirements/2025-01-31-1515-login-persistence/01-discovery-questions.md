# Discovery Questions

These questions will help understand the scope and context of the login persistence issues.

## Q1: Are users experiencing login issues across all browsers and devices?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (assuming the issue is systematic rather than browser-specific)

## Q2: Should the authentication persist even after closing and reopening the browser?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (standard behavior for most web applications with "remember me" functionality)

## Q3: Are there any security compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) that affect how long users can stay logged in?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (the site already has GDPR and CCPA pages, indicating compliance requirements)

## Q4: Do users currently have access to a "Remember Me" checkbox on the login form?
**Default if unknown:** No (based on initial codebase scan, this feature doesn't appear to be implemented)

## Q5: Should the authentication system support multiple concurrent sessions (same user logged in on different devices)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (modern web applications typically support multi-device access)
