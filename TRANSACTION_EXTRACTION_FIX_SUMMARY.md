# Transaction Extraction Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Balance Column Confusion**: The parser was extracting balance amounts instead of transaction amounts
2. **Missing Withdrawals**: All transactions were being marked as deposits, no withdrawals were detected
3. **Column Position Detection**: The parser wasn't properly identifying "Money out" vs "Money in" columns
4. **False Positives**: Phone numbers and other non-transaction data were being parsed as transactions

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue was in the `pdftotext_parser.py` which was using the second-to-last amount as the transaction amount, assuming the last amount was the balance. This logic failed for bank statements with the format:

```
Date | Description | Money out | Money In | Balance
```

Where transactions could be in either the "Money out" column (around position 62) or "Money in" column (around position 75).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Fixed Column Parser (`fixed_column_parser.py`)

This new parser:
- Detects column positions based on actual character positions in the PDF
- Correctly identifies withdrawals (Money out column at ~position 62) vs deposits (Money in column at ~position 75)
- Properly handles balance column (at ~position 86-87)
- Filters out phone numbers and non-transaction data

### 2. Key Improvements

```python
# Column position detection with tolerance
MONEY_OUT_POS = 62  # Position around 62
MONEY_IN_POS = 75   # Position around 75
BALANCE_POS = 86    # Position around 86-87
POS_TOLERANCE = 5

# Determine transaction type by column position
if abs(pos - MONEY_OUT_POS) <= POS_TOLERANCE:
    # This is a withdrawal (money out)
    transaction_amount = -abs(amt['amount'])
elif abs(pos - MONEY_IN_POS) <= POS_TOLERANCE:
    # This is a deposit (money in)
    transaction_amount = abs(amt['amount'])
```

### 3. Enhanced Validation

- Skip lines with phone numbers (pattern: x.xxx.xxx.xxxx)
- Skip lines containing "customer service" or "tdd/tty"
- Validate description length and content
- Filter out currency symbols and special characters

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- Bank Statement Example Final.pdf: 12 transactions, ALL deposits ($45,062.00 total - incorrect!)
- Merged statements: Parsing phone numbers as transactions

### After Fix
- Bank Statement Example Final.pdf: 14 transactions correctly identified:
  - 10 withdrawals: $-1,439.24
  - 4 deposits: $5,475.00
  - Matches expected totals from statement header âœ“
- Phone numbers and non-transaction data properly filtered out

## Integration

The fixed column parser has been integrated into `universal_parser.py` as Method 4 in the parsing sequence, ensuring it's tried before falling back to less accurate methods.

## Files Modified

1. `backend/fixed_column_parser.py` - New parser with column position detection
2. `backend/universal_parser.py` - Integrated fixed column parser into parsing sequence

## Recommendations

1. The fixed column parser works well for statements with clear columnar layouts
2. For other formats, the existing parsers (tabula, camelot, OCR) remain as fallbacks
3. Consider adding more bank-specific parsers if patterns emerge for specific institutions
