## Overview
The bank section has been completely redesigned with a modern, user-friendly interface that includes search and filter functionality.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Search Functionality**

- Real-time search as you type
- Searches through bank names and aliases (e.g., "BoA" will find "Bank of America")
- Shows "No results" message when no banks match the search

### 2. **Filter System**
- Added filter buttons for easy categorization:
  - **All Banks**: Shows all available banks
  - **Major Banks**: Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi
  - **Regional Banks**: US Bank, PNC, Capital One, TD Bank, etc.
  - **Online & Credit Unions**: Ally, Navy Federal, USAA, etc.
  - **By City**: City-specific bank converters

### 3. **Consistent Card Layout**
- Unified design for all bank cards
- Each card includes:
  - Bank icon (emoji for visual appeal)
  - Bank name (prominent heading)
  - Bank description
  - Category badge (color-coded)
- Hover effects for better interactivity
- Responsive grid that adapts to screen size

### 4. **Visual Hierarchy**
