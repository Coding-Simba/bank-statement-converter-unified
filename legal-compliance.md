# Legal Compliance for US Customers from Netherlands

## Data Protection Requirements

### 1. Privacy Policy Required
Since you're processing financial documents, you need:
- Clear privacy policy
- Data retention policy (you already delete after 24h âœ“)
- SSL certificate (mandatory for financial data)

### 2. US Compliance
- No PCI DSS required (not processing payments)
- Consider CCPA for California users
- State where data is processed (US servers)

### 3. EU Considerations
As a Netherlands-based business:
- GDPR still applies to you
- Need cookie consent banner
- Right to deletion (already implemented âœ“)

## Recommended Setup

1. **Terms of Service** - Add to your site
2. **Privacy Policy** - Clearly state:
   - Data is processed on US servers
   - Auto-deleted after 24 hours
   - No data sharing
   - Netherlands company serving US market

3. **Security**
   - Use HTTPS everywhere (required)
   - Encrypt uploads in transit
   - No storage of sensitive data
